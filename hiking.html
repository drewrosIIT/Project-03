        <h3>Waterfall Hike</h3>
        <img src="images/hiking.JPG" alt="Drew at Waterfall Hike">
        <p>Above I am at a waterfall hike. Waterfall hikes are interesting to me because you start to hear the water as you approach the fall, and then the end is an exciting big reveal&excl;</p>

        <h3>Yellowstone National Park</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>Old Faithful Geyser</li>
          <li>Mount Washburn</li>
          <li>Spotting A Wolf</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Yellowstone is my favorite national park for a number of reasons. Yellowstone was the first national park that I went to. It was very special for me to be exploring in the Wyoming mountains. Also, it was fun to see Old Faithful in person. I also experienced many great hikes around the park, and enjoyed the time with my family. Lastly, I loved all of the wildlife. I saw herds of bison, mooses, and more. I even spotted a wolf once when driving back from a hike in the evening. It was very cool to see the wolf appear in the trees on the side of the road, and how it acted. Yellowstone will always be a very special place to me&excl;</p>

        <h3>Glacier National Park</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>Iceberg Lake</li>
          <li>Logan Pass</li>
          <li>Going to the Sun Road</li>
        </ol>
      </section>

      <p>I think that each national park is incredibly special and unique. When I hike in a different park, the experiece is different each time, but still amazing. For instance, when I was in Zion National Park, it was 100 degrees Farenheight every day. However, when I was in Glacier National Park, it was actively snowing at the top of a big peak <strong>in July&excl;</strong> In each park, I can always experience something new&excl;</p>
